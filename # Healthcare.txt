### **Case Study: Advancing Healthcare Analysis through Data Insights**

### **Background**

You are a data analyst at HealthStat Solutions, a company specializing in healthcare analytics. You have been given two datasets: 'Patient Medical Records' and 'Hospital Treatment Details'. The 'Patient Medical Records' dataset contains detailed information on patients, including their age, gender, blood type, diagnosis, treatments, admission and discharge dates, and total bills. The 'Hospital Treatment Details' dataset provides insights into the hospitals treating these patients, including the treating doctor, room number, daily costs, treatment types, and recovery ratings.

In a healthcare industry that relies heavily on data to make informed decisions for patient care and hospital management, your role is crucial. Your task is to analyze these datasets, uncovering trends and insights that could improve patient outcomes and optimize hospital operations.

### **Objective**

As an analyst at HealthStat Solutions, your objective is to leverage Power BI for a deep dive into the provided healthcare datasets. This task encompasses meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated data modeling, utilizing DAX for advanced analytics. Your goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive dashboard in Power BI that presents a cohesive narrative of the healthcare data. This dashboard should serve as a tool to uncover and visualize important trends, such as the interplay between patient demographics and treatment outcomes, cost implications of various medical procedures, and overall hospital performance metrics. Your analysis will provide invaluable insights, aiding healthcare providers in enhancing patient care and operational efficiency, and positioning HealthStat Solutions at the forefront of healthcare analytics.

### **Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX in Power BI**

1. **Data Importing and Initial Examination**
    - Import both datasets into Power BI. Perform a preliminary examination of the data. Identify any data quality issues or inconsistencies.
2. **Merging and Relating Datasets**
    - Merge the datasets using a suitable column as a key. Ensure that the merge is accurate and retains all necessary information.
3. **Cleaning: Handling Missing and Irrelevant Data**
    - Identify and address missing data in both datasets. Address duplicate entries and irrelevant data points, ensuring data quality.
4. **Data Type Conversion**
    - Convert 'AdmissionDate' and 'DischargeDate' to the appropriate date formats. Calculate the length of stay for each patient.
5. **Categorizing Age Groups**
    - Create a new column categorizing patients into age groups (e.g., Child, Adult, Senior). What are the predominant age groups?
6. **Analysis of Treatment Costs**
    - Calculate the total cost of treatment for each patient (consider 'TotalBill' and 'DailyCost'). Which treatments are the most expensive on average?
7. **Gender Distribution in Diagnosis**
    - Analyze the distribution of genders across different diagnoses. Are there any noticeable patterns or trends?
8. **Blood Type Analysis**
    - Investigate the distribution of blood types among the patients. Is there a blood type that is more prevalent?
9. **Recovery Rating Analysis**
    - Using DAX, analyze the average recovery rating by treatment type. Which treatment type has the highest average recovery rating?
10. **Hospital Utilization Analysis**
    - Calculate the average number of patients per room in each hospital. Which hospital has the highest utilization?
11. **Doctor's Patient Load**
    - Analyze which doctor has treated the most patients. Does a higher patient load correlate with lower recovery ratings?
12. **Treatment Effectiveness**
    - Compare the length of stay against the recovery rating for different treatment types. Which treatment shows the most effectiveness?
13. **Cost Analysis by Hospital**
    - Investigate the average treatment cost per patient in each hospital. Which hospital has the highest and lowest costs?
14. **Patient Admission Trends Over Time**
    - Analyze the trends in patient admissions over time. Are there any seasonal patterns?
15. **Correlation Between Age and Recovery**
    - Explore if there's a correlation between patient age and recovery rating.
16. **Analyzing Room Efficiency**
    - Create a measure to analyze the efficiency of room usage (number of patients per room versus average length of stay).
